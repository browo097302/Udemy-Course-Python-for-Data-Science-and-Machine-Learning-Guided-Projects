# Decision Trees and Randomn Forests

For this project we will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We will try to create a model that will help predict this.
First we train a Decision Tree then a Randomn Forest and compare their performance.
