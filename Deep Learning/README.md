# Tensorflow Project

We'll use the Bank Authentication Data Set from the UCI repository and train a model to predict whether a bank note was authentic or not.

The data consists of 5 columns:

variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
entropy of image (continuous)
class (integer)
Where class indicates whether or not a Bank Note was authentic.
